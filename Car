//Design and implement a class called Car  that contains
//instance data that represents the make,  model,  and
//year  of the car (as a String, String and int value respectively). Define the Car  constructor to initialize
//these values (in that order). Include getter  and setter  methods for all
//instance data, and a toString  method that returns a
//one-line description of the car of the form



//make-model (year)

//for example:

//Ford-Thunderbird (1955)

class Car{
	int year;
	String make;
	String model;

	public Car(int y,String m,String mo){
		this.year = y;
		this.make = m;
		this.model = mo;
	}

	public String getmodel(){
		return this.model;
	}
	public String getMake(){
		return this.make;
	}
	public int getYear(){
		return this.year;
	}

	
}
